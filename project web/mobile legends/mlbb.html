        <h1>WHAT IS MLBB?</h1>
    <p>
        Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commonly referred to as ML or MLBB, is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena
         (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. Released in 2016, the game grew 
         in popularity worldwide, most prominently in Southeast Asia, and has since crossed the 1 billion downloads feat, 
         with peak monthly players of 100 million. In 2021, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang achieved an all-time gross 
         of US$1 billion with 44 percent of its revenue emanating from outside Asia, making it the top mobile game of its 
         genre with the most global appeal.
        <br><br>
        At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking 
        and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take
         the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play 
         angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.
        <br><br>
        Following success, Moonton has tapped into the esports scene with the creation of several regional tournaments 
        dubbed as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL) in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Middle East 
        and North Africa regions that serves as a qualifier for the Mobile Legends World Championships where a total of 
        15 countries, including Japan, Russia, and the United States, have participated so far. It was also among the 
        6 games chosen for the first medal event of esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games held in the 
        Philippines. 
        <br><br>
        Originally named Mobile Legends: 5v5 MOBA, the initial release of the game in 2016 was met with criticism
         citing similarities with another MOBA game, League of Legends. In July 2017, Riot Games filed a lawsuit against 
         Moonton for copyright infringement; however, the case was dismissed by the Central District Court of California 
         in the United States on account of forum non conveniens. Moonton has since then made several remodeling and 
         patch updates for distinction and game improvements.
